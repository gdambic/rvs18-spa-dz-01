 A vertex is the smallest graphical 
entity that you can manipulate. In 
short, it is a graphical point: 
Naturally, it has a 2D position (x, y), 
but also a color, and a pair of 
texture coordinates. We'll go into 
the roles of these attributes later.

Vertices (plural of vertex) alone 
don't do much. They are always 
grouped into primitives: 
 - Point (1 vertex)
 - Line (2 vertices)
 - Triangle (3 verticies)
 - Quad (4 verticies)

You can then combine 
multiple primitives together to 
create the final geometry of the 
entity. 

Vert file is simply a collection 
of quad vertex primitives. 
Its a 2D model.

Make file format more .obj like:
for e.g. represent point as
> p x y

or quad as
> q x1 y1 
> q x2 y2
> q x3 y3
> q x4 y4

Add color atribute, for eg.
> p x y color
