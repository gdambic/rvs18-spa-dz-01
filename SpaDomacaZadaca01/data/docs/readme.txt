####### ToDo #######
[x] - setup working environment
[x] - learn sfml basics from official page
[x] - learn more sfml from books
[x] - basic prototypes (drawing, anim)
[x] - make and render drawing and background
[x] - "animate" background with shader
[ ] - build asset manager
[ ] - make anim (photoshop)
[ ] - render anim

If time allows:
[ ] - make custom file format for shapes and loader for it
[ ] - build visual sprite editor that outputs sprite files

Ambitious:
[x] - learn basics of OpenGl and obj format
[x] - load simple 3D obj model (hardcoded)
[ ] - animate the simple model
[x] - make flower model (blender)
[ ] - write obj loader (obj parser)
[ ] - load and animate 3D model

Eh...
[x] - shaders?
[ ] - wind physics?
[ ] - skybox and dynamic shadows?
[ ] - randomly generated flower 3D models?
[ ] - water?
[ ] - fluid dynamics?
